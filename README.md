# Ticket History

**Ticket History** is a custom Zendesk app that displays a user's recent tickets in the ticket sidebar, along with the status, creation date, and currently assigned user. Clicking on a particular ticket will open up a preview of the requester's original comment, and also allows the user to switch directly to that ticket in the agent interface.

## Installation

Installation is simple. Simply search for the Ticket History app in the [Zendesk Apps Directory](https://www.zendesk.com/apps/) and click Install.
